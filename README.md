----USE----

This program is intended for personal use, games, scavenger/treasure hunts, etc.


---The codes----

The Caesar shift encoder/decoder takes in a shift number and a string. It works by shifting or unshifting the alphabet by the inputted number and changing the string accordingly.
The polybius square takes in a string of characters or numbers. Each letter is assigned a two-digit number and a coded or decoded string is returned. 
Substitution takes in a string and a disordered alphabet that will be used to match letters by place. Returned is a decoded string, or encoded string.
